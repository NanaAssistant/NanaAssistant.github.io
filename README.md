This is the tutorial and information center for the Nana assistant.

## What exactly is Nana?

Nana is a smart assistant based on ChatGPT for interacting with people who never used an assistant before.

It is able to handle anything and is creating a social profile of the person it's chatting with.

For the user the experience is great to learn and think about a artificial intelligence.

We're happy to be able to do that.

## How to use it

Nana is not a single program to use, but more a api to connect apps to.

We provide a few to use and we're happy to share our experience.

> ***Warning: At the moment we only allow a few people to access our application! In the future, if all tests are successful, we maybe allow other users too.***


All official applications are listed on the profile of this organization. [You can view it here](https://github.com/NanaAssistant)

## Advantages of Nana
Nana is just a small project. I got the name idea from a movie and so there is [at the moment :)] no big company behind this all. I just do this for fun.
